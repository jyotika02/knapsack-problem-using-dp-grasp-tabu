# Applying Three Diferrent Methods for Solve 0-1 Knapsack Problem 

## About the subject

This repository was created for the subject of Computer Theory. The propose of this subject is to improve your skills to solve the __0-1 knapsack__ problem of different ways. The techniques used were __Dynamic Programing__ and two metaheuristics (which are __GRASP__ and __TABU__ search).
## Assignments Description:

### Assignment 1: Dynamic Programing

The proposal of this assignment is use dynamic programing to findo the __optimal solution__ of different instance of the __0-1 knapsack__ problem. The code of implementation can be show (clicked here)[file.py].

### Assignment 2: GRASP Metaheuristic

The goal of this second assignment is using __GRASP metaheuristic__ for solve the __0-1 Knapsack__ problem. Therefore, as GRASP isn't optimal solution and of metaheuristic, then the results of each instance are close to the __optimal__. But in some instance, the result are the same of the __optimal__ solution.

### Assignment 3: TABU Metaheuristic

Tabu metaheuristic is some of search methods using to optimazing the the __GRASP__ metaheuristc. For more details about the concepts, please readme the paper (name of author)[link of paper]. Anyway, the result of this technique for __0-1 Knapsack__ problem was very satisfactory.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
  For get all of the algorithms you need to understand the "0-1 Knapsack problem" and what's metaheuristic.
```

### Usage

I other to run all of the methods, you need activate the __venv__ (virtual environment) type in your terminal the following code:

```
  source venv/bin/activate
```

The next step is run dynamic_programing, GRASP, and TABU implementations. For run the __dynamic programing__ just type the follow command in your terminal:

```
  python dynamic_programing.py
```
Already to run the __GRASP__ implementation, just type the follow command in your terminal:

```
  python grasp.py
```

And finally the last technique is the __TABU__ search, and for run the script just type the follow command in your termina:

```
  python tabu.py
```




## AcKnowledgment

  Thanks for the teacher __PhD Eduardo Theodoro Bogue__ for all the tips about the concepts of the methods.
