# Assignment of Computer Theory Subject for 0-1 Knapsack Problem

## About the subject

This repository was created for the subject __Computer Theory__. The propose of this subject is to improvement your skills to solved the 0-1 knapsack problem of different ways. About the techniques used was __Dynamic Programing__ and __two metaheuristic__ (which are __GRASP__ and __TABU__ search).

## Assignment 1: Dynamic Programing

The proposal of this assignment is use dynamic programing to findo the __optimal solution__ of different instance of the __0-1 knapsack__ problem. The code of implementation can be show (clicked here)[file.py].

#

<p align="justify">
For using the algorithm do you know <b>python</b> and some library that are util for the implementation.
The library util is:
</p>

- numpy
- re
- random

#

For more detail access the **assignment-grasp.pdf**

## Test 2:

<p align="justify">The test two is part where I had to implement  of the metaheuristic <b>Tabu</b> search for the <b>Knapsack problem 0-1</b>. 
</p>
