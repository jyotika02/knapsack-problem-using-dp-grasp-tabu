# Computer Theory

## This repository was created in order to share the assignment 1 and the test 2

#

## Assignment 1:
<p align="justify" style="font-size:18px; color:gray">Studies have shown that computer theory techniques has been bringing significant improvements. In this paper, a proposal was presented for knapsack 0-1 using GRASP heuristic-meta.
To evaluate the proposed method, different algorithms were compared for evaluated the method proposal. The result showed then grasp algorithm algorithm was equal to the optimal algorithm using dynamic programming.
</p>

#

<p align="justify">
For using the algorithm do you know <b>python</b> and some library that are util for the implementation.
The library util is:
</p>

- numpy
- re
- random

#

For more detail access the **assignment-grasp.pdf**
#
## Test 2:

<p align="justify">The test two is part where I had to implement  of the metaheuristic <b>Tabu</b> search for the <b>Knapsack problem 0-1</b>.
