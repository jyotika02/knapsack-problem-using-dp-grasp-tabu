# Solved 0-1 Knapsack Problem Using Three Diferrent Ways

## About the subject

This repository was created for the subject __Computer Theory__. The propose of this subject is to improvement your skills to solved the 0-1 knapsack problem of different ways. About the techniques used was __Dynamic Programing__ and __two metaheuristic__ (which are __GRASP__ and __TABU__ search).

## Assignments Description:

### Assignment 1: Dynamic Programing

The proposal of this assignment is use dynamic programing to findo the __optimal solution__ of different instance of the __0-1 knapsack__ problem. The code of implementation can be show (clicked here)[file.py].

### Assignment 2: GRASP Metaheuristic

The goal of this second assignment is using __GRASP metaheuristic__ for solve the __0-1 Knapsack__ problem. Therefore, as GRASP isn't optimal solution and of metaheuristic, then the results of each instance are close to the __optimal__. But in some instance, the result are the same of the __optimal__ solution.

### Assignment 3: TABU Metaheuristic

Tabu metaheuristic is some of search methods using to optimazing the the __GRASP__ metaheuristc. For more details about the concepts, please readme the paper (name of author)[link of paper]. Anyway, the result of this technique for __0-1 Knapsack__ problem was very satisfactory.

For using the algorithm do you know <b>python</b> and some library that are util for the implementation.
The library util is:
</p>

- numpy
- re
- random

## Test 2:

<p align="justify">The test two is part where I had to implement  of the metaheuristic <b>Tabu</b> search for the <b>Knapsack problem 0-1</b>.
