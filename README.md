# ComputerTheory

<p align="justify">Studies have shown that computer theory techniques has been bringing significant improvements. In this paper, a proposal was presented for knapsack 0-1 using GRASP heuristic-meta.
To evaluate the proposed method, different algorithms were compared differents methods were compared for evaluated the method proposal. The result showed then grasp algorithm algorithm was equal to the optimal algorithm using dynamic programming.

<p align="justify">
For using the algorithm do you know <b>python</b> and some library that are util for the implementation.
The library util is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>numpy</i></li>
    <li><i>re</i></li>
    <li><i>random</i></li>
</ul>
